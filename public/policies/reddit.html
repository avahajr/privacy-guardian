<hr/>
<h2 class="text-xl font-medium my-4">Introduction</h2>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="2">At Reddit, we believe that privacy is a right</span> <span id="3">We want to empower our users to be the masters of their identity</span> <span id="4">In this privacy policy, we want to help you understand how and why Reddit (“Reddit,” “we” or “us”) collects, uses, and shares information about you when you use our websites, mobile apps, widgets, APIs, emails, and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us or receive a communication from us.</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="5">We want this privacy policy to empower you to make better choices about how you use Reddit</span> <span id="6">We'd love for you to read the whole policy, but if you don't, here is the TL;DR:</span></p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-medium my-4">TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li class="mb-2 list-disc"><span id="7">Reddit is a public platform: Our communities are largely public, and anyone can see your profile, posts, and comments.</span></li>
<li class="mb-2 list-disc"><span id="8">Minimal information collection: By default, we collect minimal identifying information</span> <span id="9">Browsing can be done without an account, and account creation doesn’t require a real name.</span></li>
<li class="mb-2 list-disc"><span id="10">Data usage: We only use data to improve Reddit</span> <span id="11">We don't sell your personal data to third parties and do not work with data brokers.</span></li>
<li class="mb-2 list-disc"><span id="12">Privacy rights for everyone: All users, regardless of location, can request a copy of their data, account deletion, or information about our policies.</span></li>
<li class="mb-2 list-disc"><span id="13">Questions? Just ask: If anything is unclear, we're here to help.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-xl font-medium my-4">Reddit Is a Public Platform</h2>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="14">Much of the information on the Services is public and accessible to everyone, even without an account</span> <span id="15">By using the Services, you are directing us to share this information publicly and freely.</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="16">When you submit content (e.g., a post, comment, or chat message) to a public part of the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and the date and time you originally submitted it</span> <span id="17">That content and information may also appear in search results on internet search engines like Google or in responses provided by an AI chatbot like OpenAI’s ChatGPT</span> <span id="18">You should take the public nature of the Services into consideration before posting.</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="19">Your Reddit account has a profile page that is public</span> <span id="20">Your profile contains information about your activities on the Services, such as:
- Your username
- Prior posts and comments
- Karma
- Trophies received
- Profile display name
- About section, social links, avatar or profile image
- Moderator, contributor, and Reddit Premium status
- Communities you are active in
- How long you have been a member of the Services (your “cake day”)</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="21">We offer social sharing features that let you share content or actions you take on our Services with other media</span> <span id="22">Your use of these features enables the sharing of certain information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the third party that provides the social sharing feature</span> <span id="23">For more information about the purpose and scope of data collection and processing in connection with social sharing features, please visit the privacy policies of the third parties that provide these social sharing features (e.g., Tumblr, Facebook, and X).</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="24">Reddit allows moderators to access Reddit content using moderator bots and tools</span> <span id="25">Additionally, Reddit allows other third parties to access public Reddit content using Reddit’s developer services, including:
- Reddit Embeds
- Our APIs
- Developer Platform
- Similar technologies</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="26">We limit third-party access to this content and require third parties to pay licensing fees for access to larger quantities of content</span> <span id="27">Reddit’s Developer Terms govern how these services are used by third parties</span> <span id="28">Please review our public content policy here for more information about how your public content is publicly available and accessible to anyone with access to the internet.</span></p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-medium my-4">Information You Provide to Us</h3>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="29">We collect information you provide directly when you use the Services</span> <span id="30">This includes:</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Account Information</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="31">You don't need an account to use Reddit</span> <span id="32">If you create an account, it will have a username, which can be provided by you or generated automatically</span> <span id="33">Your username is public and does not need to be related to your real name</span> <span id="34">Depending on whether you register via email, Single Sign-On (SSO) (like Apple or Google), or phone number, you may need to provide a password</span> <span id="35">If your account doesn’t have a password, we may send an SMS message for verification</span> <span id="36">During account creation, we may ask you to select interests (e.g., history, nature, sports) or communities (e.g., r/technology) to customize your home feed.</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="37">When using Reddit, you may provide additional information, such as a bio, gender, age, location, profile picture, or social links</span> <span id="38">This information is optional and can be removed at any time</span> <span id="39">We also store your account preferences and settings</span> <span id="40">We may request information before you create an account to improve your experience.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Non-Public Content You Submit</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="41">In addition to public content, we collect non-public content, including drafts of posts or comments, private messages, chats, modmail, and reports or communications with moderators or us</span> <span id="42">This content may contain text, links, images, GIFs, audio, video, software, and tools.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Actions You Take</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="43">We collect information on actions you take when using the Services, such as voting, saving, hiding, and reporting content</span> <span id="44">This includes your interactions with other users (e.g., following, blocking) and with communities (e.g., subscriptions, moderator status).</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Transactional Information</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="45">If you purchase products or services from Reddit, you will need to provide payment information</span> <span id="46">Reddit uses industry-standard payment processors (e.g., Stripe), which are governed by separate terms and privacy policies</span> <span id="47">We collect information on the product or service purchased, such as purchase dates, amounts, and renewal dates.</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="48">We may also collect public blockchain data and addresses if you purchase or create a Collectible Avatar, receive or mint an NFT, or use Reddit Vault</span> <span id="49">However, Reddit does not store Vault private key information.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Other Information</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="50">You may provide other information directly to us</span> <span id="51">For instance, we may collect information when you fill out forms, surveys, participate in Reddit-sponsored activities, promotions, or programs, apply for a job, request customer support, or communicate with us.</span></p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-medium my-4">Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="52">When you access or use our Services, we may automatically collect information about you</span> <span id="53">This includes:</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Log and Usage Data</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="54">We may log information when you access and use the Services</span> <span id="55">This data may include:
- IP address
- User-agent string
- Browser type and operating system
- Referral URLs
- Device information (such as device IDs, device settings, and mobile carrier name)
- Pages visited, links clicked, requested URLs, and search terms</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="56">Except for the IP address used to create your account, Reddit will delete IP addresses collected after 100 days.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Information Collected from Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="57">We may receive information from cookies—small data files stored by your browser that send data back to us during requests—and similar technologies</span> <span id="58">This data helps us:
- Deliver and maintain our Services
- Improve user experience and understand activity
- Personalize content and advertisements
- Measure advertising effectiveness
- Improve Service quality</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="59">For instance, we store and retrieve data about your preferred language and other settings</span> <span id="60">For more details on how Reddit uses cookies, see our Cookie Notice</span> <span id="61">For instructions on how to disable cookies, refer to the “Your Choices” section below.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Location Information</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="62">We may receive and process information about your location</span> <span id="63">This data can be collected when you:
- Choose to share location information via the Location Customization setting
- Associate content with a location</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="64">Alternatively, we may approximate your location based on your IP address.</span></p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-medium my-4">Information Collected from Other Sources</h3>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="65">We may obtain information about you from additional sources, such as other users and third parties, and combine this with other data we have about you</span> <span id="66">Examples include:</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Demographic and Interest Information</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="67">We may receive information about your demographics or interests from third parties, like advertisers</span> <span id="68">For example, an advertiser may provide data indicating they want to show you specific ads</span> <span id="69">We may link this data with information you’ve provided to Reddit by using a common account identifier, such as a hash of your email address or a mobile-device ID</span> <span id="70">You can control how this information is used to personalize ads in the User Settings of your account, as explained in the “Your Rights and Choices” section below.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Linked Services</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="71">If you authorize a third-party service (such as an unofficial Reddit app) to access your Reddit account, Reddit will receive data about your use of that service, which may also share your account information with Reddit</span> <span id="72">For instance, if you sign in to Reddit via a third-party identity provider, the provider may share your email address with us</span> <span id="73">For more details on sharing information with linked services, see the “How Information About You Is Shared” section below.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Information from Integrated Services</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="74">We may also receive data about you, including log, usage, and cookie information, from third-party sites that integrate with our Services (e.g., sites using Reddit embeds or our advertising technology)</span> <span id="75">For example:
- Reddit Embeds: When you visit a website that includes Reddit embeds, we may receive information about the webpage you visited.
- Advertising Technology: If an advertiser uses Reddit’s ad tech, we may receive limited data about your actions on their site or app, such as a record of purchases made.</span></p>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="76">To control how this data is used to personalize your experience on Reddit, refer to Your Choices - Controlling Advertising and Analytics below.</span></p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-medium my-4">Information Collected by Third Parties</h3>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Embedded Content</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="77">Reddit includes some linked content directly within the platform through embeds</span> <span id="78">For instance, Reddit posts linking to YouTube or X (formerly Twitter) may display the video or tweet directly in your Reddit feed</span> <span id="79">This setup allows you to view content without leaving Reddit</span> <span id="80">However, Reddit does not control the data practices of these third-party services when they serve their embedded content directly to your device</span> <span id="81">Consequently, data collected through embedded content is governed by the privacy policies of the respective third-party services, not Reddit’s.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-base font-medium my-4">Audience Measurement</h4>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="82">Reddit partners with audience measurement providers to gather demographic insights about Reddit’s user base</span> <span id="83">These service providers collect information through cookies to identify your device and analyze audience demographics.</span></p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-medium my-4">Information Collected from Advertisers and Potential Advertisers</h3>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="84">If you use Reddit Ads (Reddit’s self-serve advertising platform at ads.reddit.com) on behalf of your business or organization, Reddit collects additional information</span> <span id="85">To sign up, you must provide your name, email address, and company information</span> <span id="86">Reddit may also publicly disclose certain details about your company to meet legal requirements</span> <span id="87">When purchasing advertising services, you’ll need to provide transactional details as previously described, and Reddit may require further documentation to verify your identity</span> <span id="88">Additionally, Reddit may record session replays of your visits to the Ads platform for purposes like customer service, troubleshooting, and usability research.</span></p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-medium my-4">Information Collected from Reddit Pro Users</h3>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="89">If you enroll in Reddit Pro (on behalf of yourself, your business, or organization), Reddit collects additional information, such as profile type, name, industry category, website, and organization size (if applicable)</span> <span id="90">For specific Reddit Pro features, Reddit may request additional verification documents.</span></p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-medium my-4">Information Collected from Reddit Program Participants and Potential Participants</h3>
<p class="mb-2"><span id="91">If you sign up to participate in a Reddit Program (for example, our Contributor Program), we collect, directly or indirectly through our providers, some additional information from you (such as your name, date of birth, address, email, tax, government ID, and payment information)</span> <span id="92">This additional information is used and shared with our third-party payment and compliance providers to determine your eligibility to participate in the applicable Reddit Program, facilitate payments, and comply with law</span> <span id="93">Those providers and their services are subject to separate terms and conditions and privacy policies.</span></p>
<h3 class="text-lg font-medium my-4">How We Use Information</h3>

<li class="mb-2 list-disc"><span id="107">With linked services: If you link your Reddit account with a third-party service, Reddit will share the information you authorize with that third-party service</span> <span id="108">You can control this sharing as described in "Your Rights and Choices" below.</span></li>

<p class="mb-2"><span id="128">We store the information we collect for as long as it is necessary for the purpose(s) for which we originally collected it</span> <span id="129">We may retain certain information for legitimate business purposes and/or if required by applicable law</span> <span id="130">For example, if you violate our policies and your account is suspended or banned, we may store identifiers used to create the account (such as phone number) to prevent you from creating new accounts.</span></p>

<h3 class="text-lg font-medium my-4">Controlling Promotional Communications</h3>

<p class="mb-2"><span id="172">When transferring personal data of users in the EEA, UK, and/or Switzerland, Reddit relies on Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the European Commission or other mechanisms deemed ‘adequate’ under applicable laws.</span></p>
