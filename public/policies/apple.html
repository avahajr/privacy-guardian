<h1>Apple Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><span id="1">Updated September 18, 2024.</span></p>
<p><span id="2">Apple’s Privacy Policy describes how Apple collects, uses, and shares your personal data.</span></p>
<p><span id="3">In addition to this Privacy Policy, we provide data and privacy information embedded in our products and certain
features that ask to use your personal data.</span> <span id="4">This product-specific information is accompanied by our Data &amp; Privacy
Icon.</span></p>
<p><span id="5">You will be given an opportunity to review this product-specific information before using these features.</span> <span id="6">You also can
view this information at any time, either in settings related to those features and/or online at
apple.com/legal/privacy/data.</span></p>
<h2>What Is Personal Data at Apple?</h2>
<p><span id="7">At Apple, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ
depending on where you live in the world.</span> <span id="8">That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable
individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives.</span> <span id="9">This
means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not
directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is
personal data.</span> <span id="10">Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span id="11">This Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company (collectively, “Apple”) handles personal data
whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (
including by phone or when visiting an Apple Store).</span> <span id="12">Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make
third-party apps available for download in our App Store.</span> <span id="13">Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties
define personal data or how they use it.</span> <span id="14">We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights
before interacting with them.</span></p>
<h2>Your Privacy Rights at Apple</h2>
<p><span id="15">At Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your
personal data.</span> <span id="16">We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy
rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from
Apple.</span> <span id="17">Where you are requested to consent to the processing of your personal data by Apple, you have the right to
withdraw your consent at any time.</span></p>
<p><span id="18">To exercise your privacy rights and choices, including where a third-party service provider is acting on Apple’s behalf,
visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com for Apple or shazam.com/privacy for Shazam.</span> <span id="19">To help protect
the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified.</span> <span id="20">If you want to
obtain a copy of personal data that is not currently available from privacy.apple.com, you can make a request at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.</span> <span id="21">You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the applicable regulator.</span></p>
<p><span id="22">There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data
and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law.</span> <span id="23">We may also decline to grant a
request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you
request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns.</span> <span id="24">Other reasons your privacy request may
be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical or
unreasonable.</span></p>
<p><span id="25">If you live in California and you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page, you or your authorized agent can make a
request at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact or by calling 1-800-275-2273.</span></p>

<h2>Personal Data Apple Receives from Other Sources</h2>

you a product or gift card, invited you to participate in an Apple service or forum, or shared content with you.</span></li>
<li><span id="65">At Your Direction.</span> <span id="66">You may direct other individuals or third parties to share data with Apple.</span> <span id="67">For example, you

fraud prevention, and to comply with law.</span> <span id="74">We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent.</span></p>
<p><span id="75">Apple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so.</span> <span id="76">Depending on the circumstance, Apple may
rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital
interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law.</span> <span id="77">We may also process your personal data where we believe it
is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations.</span> <span id="78">More
information is available in the product-specific information embedded in our products and features as described above.
If you have questions about the legal basis, you can contact the Data Protection Officer at
apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span id="79">Power Our Services.</span> <span id="80">Apple collects personal data necessary to power our services, which may include personal data
collected to improve our offerings, for internal purposes such as auditing or data analysis, or for troubleshooting.

play in order to provide you with the content requested and for royalty purposes.</span></li>

payment information.</span></li>
<li><span id="83">Communicate with You.</span> <span id="84">To respond to communications, reach out to you about your transactions or account, market
our products and services, provide other relevant information, or request information or feedback.</span> <span id="85">From time to time,
we may use your personal data to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our

out of receiving these important notices.</span></li>

reviewing the privacy information presented when you first use a service that asks to use your personal data.</span> <span id="92">We make

</ul>
<p><span id="95">Apple does not use algorithms or profiling to make any decision that would significantly affect you without the
opportunity for human review.</span> <span id="96">Apple also does not use or disclose sensitive personal data for any purposes that would
require a user to exercise a right to limit processing according to California law.</span></p>
<p><span id="97">Apple retains personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including
as described in this Privacy Policy or in our service-specific privacy notices, or as required by law.</span> <span id="98">We will retain
your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and our
service-specific privacy notices.</span> <span id="99">When assessing retention periods, we first carefully examine whether it is necessary
to retain the personal data collected and, if retention is required, work to retain the personal data for the shortest
possible period permissible under law.</span></p>
<h2>Apple’s Sharing of Personal Data</h2>
<p><span id="100">Apple may share personal data with Apple-affiliated companies, service providers who act on our behalf, our partners,
developers, and publishers, or others at your direction.</span> <span id="101">Further, Apple does not share personal data with third parties
for their own marketing purposes.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span id="102">Service Providers.</span> <span id="103">Apple may engage third parties to act as our service providers and perform certain tasks on our
behalf, such as processing or storing data, including personal data, in connection with your use of our services and
delivering products to customers.</span> <span id="104">Apple service providers are obligated to handle personal data consistent with this
Privacy Policy and according to our instructions.</span> <span id="105">They cannot use the personal data we share for their own purposes
and must delete or return the personal data once they’ve fulfilled our request.</span></li>
<li><span id="106">Partners.</span> <span id="107">At times, Apple may partner with third parties to provide services or other offerings.</span> <span id="108">For example,
Apple financial offerings like Apple Card and Apple Cash are offered by Apple and our partners.</span> <span id="109">Apple requires its
partners to protect your personal data.</span></li>
<li><span id="110">Developers and Publishers from Whom You Get a Subscription.</span> <span id="111">If you purchase a third-party subscription from the
App Store or within Apple News, we create a Subscriber ID that is unique to you and the developer or publisher.</span> <span id="112">The
Subscriber ID may be used to provide reports to the developer or publisher, which include information about the
subscription you purchased and your country of residence.</span> <span id="113">If you cancel all of your subscriptions from a particular
developer or publisher, the Subscriber ID will reset after 180 days if you do not resubscribe.</span> <span id="114">This information is
provided to developers or publishers so that they can understand the performance of their subscriptions.</span></li>
<li><span id="115">Others.</span> <span id="116">Apple may share personal data with others at your direction or with your consent, such as when we share
information with your carrier to activate your account.</span> <span id="117">We may also disclose information about you if we determine
that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary
or appropriate.</span> <span id="118">We may also disclose information about you where there is a lawful basis for doing so, if we determine
that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or to protect our operations or users, or
in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="119">Apple does not sell your personal data including as “sale” is defined in Nevada and California.</span> <span id="120">Apple also does not
“share” your personal data as that term is defined in California.</span></p>
<h2>Protection of Personal Data at Apple</h2>
<p><span id="121">At Apple, we believe that great privacy rests on great security.</span> <span id="122">We use administrative, technical, and physical
safeguards to protect your personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the processing, and
the threats posed.</span> <span id="123">We are constantly working to improve on these safeguards to help keep your personal data secure.</span> <span id="124">For
more information, visit our Apple Platform Security guide.</span></p>
<h2>Children and Personal Data</h2>
<p><span id="125">Apple understands the importance of safeguarding the personal data of children, which we consider to be an individual
under the age of 13 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction.</span> <span id="126">That is why Apple has implemented
additional processes and protections to help keep children’s personal data safe.</span></p>
<p><span id="127">To access certain Apple services, a child must have a child Apple Account.</span> <span id="128">A child Apple Account may be created by the
parent or, in the case of a Managed Apple Account, by the child’s educational institution.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span id="129">Parents.</span> <span id="130">To create a child account, parents must review the Family Privacy Disclosure for Children, which
describes how Apple handles children’s personal data.</span> <span id="131">If they agree, the parent must provide Apple with a verifiable
parental consent.</span></li>
<li><span id="132">Educational Institutions.</span> <span id="133">Educational institutions that participate in the Apple School Manager Program may also
create Apple IDs for students, called “Managed Apple IDs.” These schools are required to agree to the Managed Apple
IDs for Students Disclosure which is included as Exhibit A to the Apple School Manager Agreement.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="134">If we learn that a child’s personal data was collected without appropriate authorization, it will be deleted as soon as
possible.</span></p>
<p><span id="135">To exercise privacy rights for your child’s information, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com and
sign in to their account.</span></p>
<h2>Cookies and Other Technologies</h2>
<p><span id="136">Apple’s websites, online services, interactive applications, and advertisements may use “cookies” and other technologies
such as web beacons.</span> <span id="137">These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud
prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the
effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span id="138">Communications Cookies.</span> <span id="139">These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple’s systems, including by
helping us detect any errors.</span></li>
<li><span id="140">Strictly Necessary Cookies.</span> <span id="141">These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have
accessed or requested.</span> <span id="142">For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to
authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at apple.com.</span></li>
<li><span id="143">Other Cookies.</span> <span id="144">These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services,
including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.</span> <span id="145">Apple also uses these cookies
to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="146">If you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use.</span> <span id="147">If you want to disable
cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, choose “Block all cookies” in Safari’s privacy settings.</span> <span id="148">If you are
using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies.</span> <span id="149">Certain features of the Apple
website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.</span></p>
<p><span id="150">In addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.</span></p>
<p><span id="151">In some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the Apple
website.</span> <span id="152">When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page
on our website.</span> <span id="153">We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we
are communicating with you effectively.</span> <span id="154">If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or
text links in email messages.</span></p>
<p><span id="155">Apple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as non-personal data.</span> <span id="156">However, to
the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we
also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions.</span> <span id="157">In addition, Apple sometimes combines non-personal data
collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds.</span> <span id="158">When we combine data in this way, we treat the
combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span id="159">Ads that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear on the App Store, Apple News, Stocks, and Apple TV app
depending on your location.</span> <span id="160">Apple’s advertising platform does not track you, meaning that it does not link user or
device data collected from our apps with user or device data collected from third parties for targeted advertising or
advertising measurement purposes, and does not share user or device data with data brokers.</span></p>
<p><span id="161">If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple's advertising platform in those apps, you can
choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple Account out of receiving such ads regardless of what
device you are using.</span> <span id="162">On your iOS, iPadOS, or visionOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings &gt;
Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads.</span> <span id="163">On your Mac, you can disable
Personalized Ads by going to System Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Privacy &gt; Advertising, then deselecting Personalized
Ads.</span> <span id="164">You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the
channel you are reading.</span> <span id="165">If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the
Advertising Identifier, a non-personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across
apps and websites owned by other companies.</span></p>
