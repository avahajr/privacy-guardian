<h1>INFORMATION GOOGLE COLLECTS</h1>
<h2>We Want You To Understand The Types Of Information We Collect As You Use Our Services</h2>

<h1>WHY GOOGLE COLLECTS DATA</h1>

<h2>Maintain &amp; Improve Our Services</h2>
<p><span id="50">We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us.</span> <span id="51">And we use your information to make improvements to our services - for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.</span></p>
<h2>Develop New Services</h2>
<p><span id="52">We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones.</span> <span id="53">For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google's first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.</span></p>
<h2>Provide Personalized Services, Including Content And Ads</h2>
<p><span id="54">We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results.</span> <span id="55">For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products.</span> <span id="56">And, depending on your available settings, Google Play could use information like apps you've already installed and videos you've watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.</span></p>
<p><span id="57">Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests and activity across Google services.</span> <span id="58">For example, if you search for "mountain bikes," you may see ads for sports equipment on YouTube.</span> <span id="59">You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings in My Ad Center.</span></p>
<p><span id="60">We don't show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.</span></p>
<p><span id="61">We don't show you personalized ads based on your content from Drive, Gmail, or Photos.</span></p>
<p><span id="62">We don't share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to.</span> <span id="63">For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the "tap to call" button, we'll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.</span></p>
<p><span id="64">Go to My Ad Center.</span></p>
<h2>Measure Performance</h2>
<p><span id="65">We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used.</span> <span id="66">For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design.</span> <span id="67">And we also use data about the ads you interact with, including your related Google Search activity, to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns.</span> <span id="68">We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics.</span> <span id="69">When you visit sites or use apps that use Google Analytics, a Google Analytics customer may choose to enable Google to link information about your activity from that site or app with activity from other sites or apps that use our ad services.</span></p>
<h2>Communicate With You</h2>
<p><span id="70">We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly.</span> <span id="71">For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location.</span> <span id="72">Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services.</span> <span id="73">And if you contact Google, we'll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.</span></p>

<p><span id="81">We may use the information we collect across our services and across your devices for the purposes described above.</span> <span id="82">For example, depending on your available settings, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products.</span> <span id="83">Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google's services and the ads delivered by Google.</span></p>
<p><span id="84">If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo.</span> <span id="85">This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.</span></p>

<h2>Activity On Google Services</h2>
<p><span id="303">If you're signed in to your Google Account and have Web &amp; App Activity turned on, your activity data on Google sites, apps, and services may be saved in your account's Web &amp; App Activity.</span> <span id="304">Some activity may include information about the general area you were in when using the Google service.</span> <span id="305">When you search for something using a general area, your search will use an area of at least 3 sq km, or expand until the area represents the locations of at least 1,000 people.</span> <span id="306">This helps protect your privacy.</span></p>
<p><span id="307">In some cases, areas that you have searched from in the past may be used to estimate a relevant location for your search.</span> <span id="308">For example, if you search for coffee shops while in Chelsea, Google might show results for Chelsea in future searches.</span></p>

<h3>Make Improvements</h3>
<p><span id="344">For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services.</span> <span id="345">And that analysis can help us build better products.</span> <span id="346">For example, it may help us discover that it's taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all.</span> <span id="347">We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.</span></p>
<h3>May Link Information</h3>
<p><span id="348">Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer.</span> <span id="349">Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites.</span> <span id="350">For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic.</span> <span id="351">Learn more.</span></p>
<h3>Our Users</h3>

<h1>Safety And Reliability</h1>
<p><span id="376">Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:
Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse.</span> <span id="377">This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.</span></p>
